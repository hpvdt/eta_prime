The OV5640 and IMX219 are both the Raspberry Pi Camera Modules. The IMX219 is a 
little more powerful and current, so it was selected. It is also more expensive
at ~$25 instead of ~$15. Both of these options use 1/4" optics, which is
hopefully small enough. They seem to be able to be detached from the ~1X1" PCB
they are mounted on; if this is not the case this could be a problem. The
PCB does have components mounted on it, which would need to be reverse engineered
in the complete solution. However it is unlikely they are anything more than 
just a power supply.

If smaller options than this are needed, the OV2722 and OV2685 can be used. The
OV2722 is available on Alibaba but potentially not in single quantity orders.
The OV2685 is available on a ribbon cable from Leopard Imaging.
